# redis-clj

Redis implemented in Clojure.

This is just a small learning project so it does not handle error/edge cases very well and doesn't even pass the `redis-benchmark` default test. But it works :)

## Usage

```sh
lein run
```

## Test

```sh
pytest # if you have it enabled, otherwise:
python test/test_server.py
```
